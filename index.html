                <p class="p">An unnamed male high school student comes across a book in a hospital waiting room. He soon
                    discovers that it is a diary kept by his very popular classmate Sakura Yamauchi, who reveals to him that
                    she is secretly suffering from a fatal illness in her pancreas. Despite this, Sakura intends to maintain
                    a normal school life and thus is drawn to him due to his relatively unfazed reaction to her condition.
                    They begin to spend time together and become friends. <br>
                    During their school break, Sakura invites him on a train trip to Fukuoka where they play truth-or-dare
                    game and eventually share a bed in their hotel room. Afterward, Sakura's friends and classmates grow
                    suspicious and resentful of his newfound closeness to her. The two begin doing activities from Sakura's
                    bucket list together until she is suddenly hospitalized. During her hospitalization, the two sneak out
                    to see fireworks together. <span class="readme"><a

                    wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. Soon, she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki
                    Tachibana, a boy from Tokyo. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's bodies and must
                    live the entire day as the other, reverting when they go to sleep at night. The two set up ground rules
                    for sharing their bodies, communicating via messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha (in
                    Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body)
                    helps Mitsuha become more popular at school. While in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's

Suga gives the boy his business card and tells him to call if he needs a job. Hodaka struggles to find work in the city. He finds an abandoned Makarov PM handgun and keeps it even though guns are illegal. He meets Hina Amano, a McDonald's employee, who pities him and gives him free food. Suga hires him as his assistant; he and his niece publish a small occult magazine investigating strange phenomena, including the unusually rainy weather. They hear the legend of "sunshine girls" who can stop rain, and bring sunshine. Hodaka sees Hina being intimidated into working at a club and in panic, fires his gun at the club owner, barely missing him. Frightened, he throws the gun aside. Hina takes him to Yoyogi Kaikan, an abandoned building with a shrine

Military children of an Imperial Japanese Navy captain, Seita and his sister Setsuko, survive, but their mother is severely injured and later dies. Seita conceals their mother's death from Setsuko to keep her happy. The siblings move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops, which he later gives to Setsuko. The aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk kimonos for rice.
                    
                    As rations continue to shrink, the aunt becomes resentful of the children as Seita does nothing to earn the food she prepares for them. At her suggestion, Seita withdraws some money from his mother's bank account to buy a charcoal stove and other supplies. One night in the summer, following an air raid, the two decide to move into an abandoned

She always flirts with her crush, the handsome Kento Hinode, even though he has no romantic feelings for her at all, and often stays away from her. One day, she receives a magical Noh mask from a mysterious mask seller, which lets her become a cat. As "Tarō,"  she spends time with Hinode, keeps him company while he studies Japanese pottery, and listens to his problems. She longs to confess that the cat he loves and the girl he dislikes are the same person.
    
    One day, Miyo overhears two boys at school insulting Hinode and loudly intervenes by jumping off the school building to defend his honor. She hurts herself during the jump, and for the first time, Hinode shows warmth as he takes her to the nurse and shares his lunch with her. Later that evening, as Tarō,
